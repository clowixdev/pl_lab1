# Laboratory work for University

### Principles of optimizing compilers

In this laboratory work we have to learn how to deal with optimizing compilers
and try them by ourselves.

We had some source code with parts that can be optimized by compilers,
and we compared assembly codes of optimized and none optimized binary files.
